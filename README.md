# My Shellscritps

Collection of script that you use to help my laziness to take my hand off the keyboard.

## Scripts inside
What's in the project is what it does.

##### $ bluefilter.sh
Decreases the color temperature.

#### $ mic_stats.sh
Check whether the microphone is muted or not.

#### $ mictest.sh
Loopback to output the input audio.

#### $ mic_toggle.sh
Mute and unmute microphone.

## Configure
I place these scripts inside ```/opt/Shellscripts``` and export to $PATH.

```bash
export PATH=/opt/ShellScripts/:$PATH
```

I use the keyboard shortcut configuration to call some scripts, and if necessary I can call them directly from the terminal.
